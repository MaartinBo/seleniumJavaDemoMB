# How to use it
If you want to use these tests, you need to set up your chrome driver/firefox driver and add the path to them to your env variables on the computer.

I don't use wedrivermanager from io.github.bonigarcia version 5.4.1
because IntelliJ shows a lot of unsecured vulnerabilities in this package.
              
So I'm not sure if is it safe to use.

In the future, if they fix that, I will probably switch to that method.
